# Music-Catalog
A music catalog written in Java that interfaces with an SQLite database to store and retrieve data. This was written for a software development class focusing on agile methodologies.

To setup, clone the repository and open the project at interface/ in Eclipse. Then run the file at interface/src/edu.miamioh.CSE201.project.database/InitializeDatabase.java. After that is complete, the database should be ready to go, so run the file at interface/src/edu.miamioh.CSE201.project.ui/Main.java to launch the GUI.
